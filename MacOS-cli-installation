MacOS - installation of AWS cli, Azure cli and Google Cloud cli, and docker /docker engine

- Azure Cli
Ref:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos?view=azure-cli-latest

$ bash
$ brew update && brew install azure-cli
$ which az

Important
The Azure CLI has a dependency on the python3 package in Homebrew, and will install it on your system, even if Python 2 is available. The Azure CLI is guaranteed to be compatible with the latest version of python3 published on Homebrew.
&
There may be a minor version mismatch or other issue during homebrew installation. The CLI doesn't use a Python virtual environment, so it relies on finding the installed Python version. A possible fix is to install and relink the python3 dependency from Homebrew.
$ bash 
$ brew update && brew install python3 && brew upgrade python3
$ brew link --overwrite python3

Run Azure cli
$az login

AWS cli

$ brew install awscli
The aws cli will be installed in /usr/local/bin

Check if its working
$ which aws
$ aws help

Checking brew inventory/pkgs
$brew info
$brew list
$brew search awscli

Brew Commands
This section provide a quick set of commands on how to install AWS CLI on macOS using Homebrew. It is assumed that Homebrew is already installed. If not, please follow this link.

$ brew update             # Fetch latest version of homebrew and formula.
$ brew search awscli      # Searches all known formulae for a partial or exact match.
$ brew info awscli        # Displays information about the given formulae.
$ brew install awscli     # Install the given formulae.
$ brew cleanup  

Google Cloud cli (google cloud SDK)
Strongly recommend to install the SDK with virtual environment setup
$ pip install virtualenv    (if you don’t have it on your Mac with python3)
~
$ python -V
Python 3.7.3

Create python3 vituralenv
$ python -m venv ~/cloud/gcloud-venv

Activate virtualenv
$ source ~/cloud/gloud-venv/bin/activate 

Following the instructions below:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos

1)	Create Google Cloud project
2)	Make sure the python 2.7 is available (or python3)
3)	Download two tar.gz files and extracted to location where you like to…and have PATH setup
For example, ~/cloud/gcloud
4)	Optional: If you're having trouble getting the gcloud command to work, ensure your $PATH is defined appropriately. Use the install script to add Cloud SDK tools to your path. You will also be able to opt-in to command-completion for your bash shell and usage statistics collection during the installation process. Run the script using this command:
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
Restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.
Docker and docker engine (cli) (toolbox) not docker desktop(GUI) 
Note: Docker toolbox and desktop can be coexisted.
$ brew install docker docker-machine

Ref: 
https://medium.com/@yutafujii_59175/a-complete-one-by-one-guide-to-install-docker-on-your-mac-os-using-homebrew-e818eb4cfc3

Example from: 
If you would like to have virtualbox installed on Mac with version of 10.14 and above you will encounter installation failure! See DMeechan

Optional 
$ brew cask install virtualbox
-> need password
-> possibly need to address System Preference setting

Only applied to Virtualbox with new vm image – if you would like to create docker engine on public clouds, Aws, Gcloud, Azure…please follow 

will create virtualbox image called default
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
$ docker-machine env default
$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
$ docker run hello-world
$ docker-machine stop default

To start docker engine on Mac
On the Mac, click on docker GUI which is asking for access 
Click ok and then type user/passwd

How to uninstall docker toolbox ?
Ref:
https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/#how-to-uninstall-toolbox

Removing Toolbox involves removing all the Docker components it includes.
A full uninstall also includes removing the local and remote machines you created with Docker Machine. In some cases, you might want to keep machines created with Docker Machine.
For example, if you plan to re-install Docker Machine as a part of Docker Desktop for Mac you can continue to manage those machines through Docker. Or, if you have remote machines on a cloud provider and you plan to manage them using the provider, you wouldn’t want to remove them. So the step to remove machines is described here as optional.
To uninstall Toolbox on a Mac, do the following:
1.	List your machines.
2.	$ docker-machine ls
3.	NAME                ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                        SWARM
4.	dev                 *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.1.100:2576
5.	my-docker-machine            virtualbox   Stopped
6.	default                      virtualbox   Stopped

Optionally, remove each machine. For example:
$ docker-machine rm my-docker-machine
Successfully removed my-docker-machine

•  This step is optional because if you plan to re-install Docker Machine as a part of Docker Desktop for Mac, you can import and continue to manage those machines through Docker.
•  In your “Applications” folder, remove the “Docker” directory, which contains “Docker Quickstart Terminal” and “Kitematic”.
•  Run the following in a command shell to fully remove Kitematic:
$ rm -fr ~/Library/Application\ Support/Kitematic

•  Remove the docker, docker-compose, and docker-machine commands from the /usr/local/bin folder. Docker Desktop for Mac and Brew may also have installed them; in case of doubt leave them, or reinstall them via Brew, or rerun Docker Desktop for Mac (no need to reinstall it).
$ rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker
$ rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

•  Optionally, remove the ~/.docker/machine directory.
This directory stores some configuration and/or state, such as information about created machines and certificates.
•  Uninstall Oracle VirtualBox, which is installed as a part of the Toolbox install.
